# Pitch

GeoPivot is powered by AI, Machine Learning, earth911 data and mobile technologies to bring the convenience of recycling to people's homes.

## Additional Information

Worldwide it is difficult to identify what can and cannot be recycled and where.
GeoPivot makes recycling easier, allowing users to take/upload pictures with mobile phones. It uses Tensorflow object detection, Earth911 data, Flutter maps to enable accurate prediction of images for recycling and show nearest recycle centre. The application is secure, using Firebase authentication for email/password and Goole sign-in. GeoPivot is tested and deployed to both Andriod and ios platforms.
